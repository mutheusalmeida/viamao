# ViaMão

A simple travel planner built with Astro, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as a challenge for a position at [Buzzvel](https://buzzvel.com).

"Via" suggesting "Viagem" (which means "Travel" in Portuguese) and "Mão" which means "Hand" in Portuguese: your next trip in the palm of your hand.

I created the design and built the frontend and backend. You can checkout the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/D7efSVd1XmW8yjm69rhZX7/ViaM%C3%A3o?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ffL9CWzFshepUdVO-0).

## Features

- Astro Endpoints
- SSR with Astro
- Goole Places API
- Shadcn components
- Form validation with React Hook Form and Zod
